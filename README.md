# RankCreate

`RankCreate.py` is a Python utility script that automates the ranking of items based on predefined metrics and criteria. It is designed to be flexible, allowing users to input data which the script will process to output a ranked list. This script is intended for anyone who requires an automated system for ranking entities, such as products, articles, or any type of content or data that needs ordering according to rank.

## Features

- **Customizable Input**: The script accepts user input through various means, including command-line arguments, input files, or direct API calls.
- **Dynamic Ranking**: Users can define their own metrics and weights that affect the ranking algorithm tailored to specific needs.
- **Output Generation**: Automatically generates a `ranks.yml` file with the ranked entities in a structured and accessible format.

## Usage

To use `RankCreate.py`, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The script may require additional Python packages, which can be installed using `pip`.

```
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
python RankCreate.py
```

The resulting `ranks.yml` file will be created in the same directory as the script, or in a specified output directory.

## Integrating with GitHub Actions

`RankCreate.py` is designed with CI/CD in mind and can be incorporated into a GitHub Actions workflow. You can find an example workflow in the `.github/workflows` directory that demonstrates how to trigger the script on a push to the main branch and generate a new release with the created `ranks.yml` file.
